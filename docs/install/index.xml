VERSION=0.5.5 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release-$VERSION.yaml If you would like to install the current development version you can simply install it like this :
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/nightly/release.yaml This will apply the release.yaml to your kubernetes cluster, creating the admin namespace pipelines-as-code, the roles and all other bits needed.
The pipelines-as-code namespace is where the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure runs and is supposed to be accessible only by the admins.</description></item><item><title>Settings</title><link>/docs/install/settings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/settings/</guid><description>Pipelines-As-Code configuration settings # There is a few things you can configure via the configmap pipelines-as-code in the pipelines-as-code namespace.
application-name
The name of the application showing for example in the GitHub Checks labels. Default to &amp;quot;Pipelines as Code CI&amp;quot;
max-keep-days
The number of the day to keep the PipelineRuns runs in the pipelines-as-code namespace. We install by default a cronjob that cleans up the PipelineRuns generated on events in pipelines-as-code namespace.</description></item><item><title>Github Apps</title><link>/docs/install/github_apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/github_apps/</guid><description>Create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App # The GitHub App install is different than other install methods since it acts as the integration point with OpenShift Pipelines and brings the Git workflow into Tekton pipelines. You only need one GitHub App for every users on the cluster usually setup by the admin.
You need the webhook of the GitHub App to point to your Pipelines-as-Code Controller route/ingress endpoint which would listen to GitHub events.</description></item><item><title>Github Webhook</title><link>/docs/install/github_webhook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/github_webhook/</guid><description>Install Pipelines-as-Code as a GitHub Webhook # If you are not able to create a GitHub application you can install Pipelines-as-Code on your repository as a GitHub Webhook.
Using Pipelines as Code via Github webhook does not give you access to the GitHub CheckRun API, therefore the status of the tasks will be added as a Comment of the PR and not via the Checks Tab.
Following the infrastructure installation</description></item><item><title>Gitlab</title><link>/docs/install/gitlab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/gitlab/</guid><description>Install Pipelines-as-Code for Gitlab # Pipelines-As-Code supports Gitlab via a webhook.
Following the infrastructure installation:
You will have to generate a personal token as the manager of the Org or the Project, follow the steps here :
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html
Note: You can create a token scoped only to the project. Since the token needs to be able to have api access to the forked repository from where the MR come from, it will fail to do it with a project scoped token.</description></item><item><title>Bitbucket Cloud</title><link>/docs/install/bitbucket_cloud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/bitbucket_cloud/</guid><description>Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Cloud # Pipelines-As-Code has a full support on Bitbucket Cloud on https://bitbucket.org as Webhook.
Following the infrastructure installation :
You will have to generate an app password for Pipelines-as-Code Bitbucket API operations. Follow this guide to create an app password : https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/
Add those permissions to the token :

Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to recreate it.</description></item><item><title>Bitbucket Server</title><link>/docs/install/bitbucket_server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/bitbucket_server/</guid><description>Install Pipelines-As-Code on Bitbucket Server # Pipelines-As-Code has a full support of Bitbucket Server.
Following the infrastructure installation :
You will have to generate a personal token as the manager of the Project, follow the steps here : https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html
The token will need to have the PROJECT_ADMIN and REPOSITORY_ADMIN permissions.
Note that the token needs to be able to have access to the forked repository in pull requests or it would not be able to process and access the pull request.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes</title><link>/docs/install/kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/kubernetes/</guid><description>Kubernetes # Pipelines as Code should work directly on kubernetes/minikube/kind. You just need to install the release.yaml for pipeline , triggers and its interceptors on your cluster. The release yaml to install pipelines are for the released version :
VERSION=0.5.3 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release-$VERSION.k8s.yaml and for the nightly :
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release.k8s.yaml If you have Tekton Dashboard. You can just add the key tekton-dashboard-url in the pipelines-as-code configmap set to the full url of the Ingress host to get tekton dashboard logs url.</description></item></channel></rss>
