      <description>Pipelines as Code resolver #  If Pipelines as Code sees a PipelineRun with a reference to a Task or a Pipeline, it will tries to resolves it as a single PipelineRun with an embedded PipelineSpec to a PipelineRun.
It will as well transform the Pipeline Name to a generateName based on the Pipeline name as well.
This allows you to have multiple runs in the same namespace from the same PipelineRun with no risk of conflicts.</description>
