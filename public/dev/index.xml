      <description>Release process for Pipelines as Code #   Clear out the PR needed to be merged. Wait that CI is connected. Make sure the CI PAC cluster is up. Make sure you have gpg signing setup for your commits. You need to install python package semver :  pip3 install --user semver  Use this script which should do most things :  ./hack/make-release.sh   Choose a version if it&amp;rsquo;s a major release/minor or patch release and let it push the new tags which should kick off pipelines as code release pipelines.</description>
