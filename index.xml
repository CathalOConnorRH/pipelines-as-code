You only need one GitHub App for every users on the cluster usually setup by the admin.
You need the webhook of the GitHub App to point to your Pipelines-as-Code Controller route/ingress endpoint which would listen to GitHub events.</description></item><item><title>Resolver</title><link>/docs/guide/resolver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/guide/resolver/</guid><description>Pipelines as Code resolver # If Pipelines as Code sees a PipelineRun with a reference to a Task or a Pipeline, it will tries to resolves it as a single PipelineRun with an embedded PipelineSpec to a PipelineRun.
It will as well transform the Pipeline Name to a generateName based on the Pipeline name as well.
This allows you to have multiple runs in the same namespace from the same PipelineRun with no risk of conflicts.</description></item><item><title>CLI tkn-pac</title><link>/docs/guide/cli/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/guide/cli/</guid><description>Pipelines as Code CLI # Pipelines as Code provide a powerful CLI designed to work with tkn plugin. tkn-pac allows you to :

Using Pipelines as Code via Github webhook does not give you access to the GitHub CheckRun API, therefore the status of the tasks will be added as a Comment of the PR and not via the Checks Tab.

Following the infrastructure installation:
You will have to generate a personal token as the manager of the Org or the Project, follow the steps here :
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html
Note: You can create a token scoped only to the project. Since the token needs to be able to have api access to the forked repository from where the MR come from, it will fail to do it with a project scoped token.</description></item><item><title>Bitbucket Cloud</title><link>/docs/install/bitbucket_cloud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/bitbucket_cloud/</guid><description>Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Cloud # Pipelines-As-Code has a full support on Bitbucket Cloud on https://bitbucket.org as Webhook.
Following the infrastructure installation :

Add those permissions to the token :

Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to recreate it.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/install/bitbucket_server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/install/bitbucket_server/</guid><description>Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Server # Pipelines-As-Code has a full support of Bitbucket Server.
Following the infrastructure installation :
